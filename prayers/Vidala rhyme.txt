Just look at Tirzah! She sits there,
With her strands of vagrant hair;
See her down the sidewalk stride,
Head held high and full of pride.
See her catch the Guardian's glance,
Tempt him to sinful circumstance.
Never does she change her way,
Never does she kneel to pray!
Soon she into sin will fall,
And then be hanging on the Wall.
