Under His Eye our beams of truth shine out,
We see all sin;
We shall observe you at your goings-out,
Your comings-in.
From every heart we wrench the secret vice,
In prayers and tears decree the sacrifice.
Sworn to obey, obedience we command,
We shall not swerve!
To duties harsh, we lend a willing hand,
We pledge to serve.
All idle thoughts, all pleasures we must quell,
Self we renounce, in selflessness we dwell.
